## üìÑ Overview

**React To-Do Master** is a client-side web application developed by Adrian Lesniak for managing daily tasks. Built with **React** and utilizing core **React Hooks** (`useState` for state management, `useEffect` for side effects like localStorage synchronization), it allows users to seamlessly add new tasks, edit existing ones, mark tasks as completed (visually indicated by a strikethrough), and delete tasks. A key feature is its use of the browser's **localStorage** to persist tasks, ensuring that the to-do list remains available across browser sessions. The application features a simple, clean user interface styled with custom CSS (`App.css`) and presents its UI elements in Polish.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üìù **Full Task CRUD Operations**:
    *   **Add Tasks**: Input new tasks via a text field; non-empty validation applied.
    *   **Edit Tasks**: Modify the text of existing tasks using a `prompt()` dialog.
    *   **Mark as Completed**: Toggle task completion status, visually represented by a strikethrough (`<s>` tag).
    *   **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
*   üíæ **LocalStorage Persistence**:
    *   Automatically saves the current list of tasks to the browser's localStorage.
    *   Tasks are loaded from localStorage when the application starts or the page is reloaded, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
*   ‚öõÔ∏è **React Hooks for State Management**:
    *   `useState`: Manages the state of the tasks list and the current input field value.
    *   `useEffect`: Synchronizes the tasks state with localStorage whenever the tasks list changes and on initial load.
*   üé® **Simple & Interactive User Interface**:
    *   A dedicated input field for adding new tasks.
    *   Each task in the list is displayed with action buttons:
        *   "Oznacz jako wykonane" (Mark as done)
        *   "Edytuj" (Edit)
        *   "Usu≈Ñ" (Delete)
*   üíÖ **Custom Styling**:
    *   Styled with custom CSS rules defined in `src/App.css` to provide a clean layout and visual appeal.
*   üáµüá± **Polish Language Interface**: All user-facing buttons and prompts are in Polish (e.g., "Dodaj", "Edytuj", "Usu≈Ñ").

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Requirements

### Core Technologies:
*   **Frontend Library**: React (v17+ recommended, utilizing Hooks)
*   **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Styling**: CSS3 (`src/App.css`)
*   **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
*   **Persistence**: Browser localStorage API

### Development Environment:
*   **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher (for running `npm`/`yarn` and the development server).
*   **Package Manager**: `npm` (Node Package Manager) or `yarn`.
*   **Web Browser**: Any modern web browser with JavaScript and localStorage support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Local Assets (within a Create React App structure):
*   `src/App.js`: The main React component containing the application logic and JSX for the UI.
*   `src/App.css`: The stylesheet for custom styling of the application.
*   (Typically also `src/index.js` to render `App` and `public/index.html` as the entry point).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with your specific details).*

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server**:
    Once dependencies are installed, start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or with yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

4.  **Access the Application**:
    *   The development server will typically open the application automatically in your default web browser.
    *   If not, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated in your terminal).

## üí° Application Usage

1.  Open the **React To-Do Master** application in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
2.  **Interface**:
    *   **Input Field**: At the top (or a designated area), you'll find a text input field and an "Dodaj" (Add) button.
    *   **Task List**: Below the input field, any existing tasks will be displayed. If it's your first time or localStorage is empty, this list will be empty.
3.  **Actions**:
    *   **Adding a Task**:
        *   Type your task description into the input field.
        *   Click the "Dodaj" button.
        *   The new task will appear in the list below. Empty inputs are ignored.
    *   **Marking a Task as Done**:
        *   Click the "Oznacz jako wykonane" button next to a task.
        *   The task text will be struck through to indicate completion. Clicking again might toggle this status.
    *   **Editing a Task**:
        *   Click the "Edytuj" button next to a task.
        *   A `prompt()` dialog will appear, pre-filled with the current task text.
        *   Modify the text and click "OK." The task in the list will update.
    *   **Deleting a Task**:
        *   Click the "Usu≈Ñ" button next to a task.
        *   The task will be removed from the list.
4.  **Persistence**:
    *   All changes (additions, edits, completions, deletions) are automatically saved to your browser's localStorage.
    *   If you reload the page or close and reopen the browser, your tasks will be retrieved from localStorage and displayed.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure (Typical Create React App)

The project is expected to follow a structure similar to that created by `create-react-app`:

*   `public/`:
    *   `index.html`: The main HTML shell for the React application.
    *   Other static assets (favicon, manifest, etc.).
*   `src/`:
    *   `App.js`: The main React component containing the to-do list logic, state management, and JSX for rendering the UI.
    *   `App.css`: The CSS file for styling the `App` component and its children.
    *   `index.js`: The JavaScript entry point that renders the `App` component into the DOM.
    *   (Potentially other component files if the app is broken down further).
*   `package.json`: Lists project dependencies, scripts (like `start`, `build`), etc.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

## üìù Important Notes & Considerations

*   **Polish UI**: The application's user interface (button labels, prompts) is in Polish. It can be easily translated by modifying the string literals in `App.js`.
*   **Task Completion State**: Marking tasks as done uses HTML `<s>` tags for a visual strikethrough. A more robust approach would be to add a boolean `isCompleted` flag to each task object in the state, and then conditionally apply a CSS class for styling completed tasks. This provides better state management and flexibility.
*   **Edit Feature UX**: The edit functionality uses the browser's native `prompt()`. While simple, this offers a limited user experience. For a more polished application, consider replacing this with an inline editing input field or a custom modal dialog component.
*   **Client-Side Only**: This is a purely client-side application. All data is stored in the user's browser via `localStorage`. There is no backend server or database involved.
*   **`App.css` Styling**: The visual appearance relies on the styles defined in `App.css`. Ensure this file exists and contains appropriate styling rules.
*   **localStorage Limitations**:
    *   `localStorage` has storage limits (typically 5-10MB per origin).
    *   Data is stored as strings, so `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` are used for saving and retrieving the tasks array.
    *   It's synchronous, which can block the main thread if data is very large (though unlikely for a typical to-do list).
    *   Consider adding error handling for scenarios where `localStorage` might be full or unavailable, or if stored JSON is corrupt.
